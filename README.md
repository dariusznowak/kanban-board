# Kanban Board project
Create your own tasks and manage them. You can use buttons or you can drag the tasks between taskboards using your mouse. Your tasks will be saved in your browser's **local storage** so you can check them out any time you want to.

This app was created using **React.js** library.<br>
It's fully resposive which I managed to achieve by using **CSS Grid** and **CSS Flexbox** modules.<br>
Drag and drop feature was developed using **react-dnd** package.
